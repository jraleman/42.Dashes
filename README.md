## Dashes

I'll add all the dashes, which are programming problems that we need to solve
real quick. We just have 30 minutes to fully complete them and turn them in.

* dash_blackjack
	- The function must calculate the value of a blackjack hand.
* clear_duplicate
	- The function must remove each duplicate node in a simple linked list.
* gimme_value
	- The function must return the amount of occurrence of a character (char c)
	in a string array (char **tab).
